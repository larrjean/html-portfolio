<h1>TOP MOVIES FOR LARRAINE</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies as of date and WHY</h2>
<hr />

<h3>1. Shutter Island</h3>
<p>
The best psychological thriller movie that had me questioning the ending for years. Until I just accepted that's how the director wanted it to be. 
</p>

<h3>2. Argo</h3>
<p>
This movie had me shook and on my feet from beginning to end. Can't predict what could happen next. And I was amazed how the director and the lead actor is one and the same. 
</p>

<h3>3. Miracle in Cell No. 7</h3>
<p>
Painful, sad story involving a mentally challenged father trying to care for her daughter. It may have started that way but the end was vindicating.
